# Russian travel

**Intro**

My second learning project for Yandex Practicum.  
This project is full of beautiful images from different regions of Russia. Enjoy it! 

**Technologies:**

- HTML + CSS;
- Adaptive layout;  
- Grid;
- Flexbox;
- BEM nested.

[See the project](https://hryushek.github.io/russian-travel/index.html).  
Russian language.

**Plans to improve:**
- Try responsive instead of adaptive layout.
